# Definitional interpreter for the simply typed lambda calculus (STLC) extended with natural numbers and primitive recursion (in Agda)

_Author: Bernarda Petek_

This is the class project for the subject Logic in Computer Science at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Ljubljana, 2022. 

## Implementation

The base of this project is STLC with with a unit type, product type, and function type. I extend STLC with another type - natural numbers. This is similar to Gödel’s System T, a type system based on the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus which includes not only natural numbers but also booleans. Just as in Gödel’s System T, I too extend STLC with primitive recursion.
